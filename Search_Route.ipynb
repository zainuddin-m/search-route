The goal is to find the route from node 1 (start) to node 5 (goal). Each edge in the graph has a specific cost, which represents the distance between nodes.\n","\n","The objective is to:\n","\n","Determine the routes found by each search algorithm.\n","Evaluate their total costs.\n","Compare their performance and discuss their suitability for solving similar problems.\n","The graph contains weighted edges, meaning the cost of each path must be considered to determine the optimal solution. While BFS and DFS focus on the structure of the graph, UCS takes into account the edge costs to guarantee the least-cost path. The results will highlight the trade-offs between algorithm efficiency and optimality.\n","\n","## Implementation and Results\n","The graph was represented as an adjacency list, with each node linked to its neighbors and corresponding edge costs. Three search algorithms were implemented: Breadth-First Search (BFS) using a queue to explore nodes level by level, Depth-First Search (DFS) using a stack to explore nodes deeply before backtracking, and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) using a priority queue to expand nodes based on cumulative costs (g(n)). For each algorithm, the path was reconstructed from the goal to the start using parent pointers, and the nodes expanded during the search were tracked to evaluate efficiency.\n","\n","The results showed that BFS and DFS both found the same route, [1,6,5], with a total cost of 23. These methods ignored edge costs and focused solely on the graph structure, leading to suboptimal solutions. In contrast, UCS found the optimal route, [1,3,6,5], with a total cost of 20 by considering edge weights and expanding nodes with the least cumulative cost. This demonstrates UCS’s strength in finding the least-cost path in weighted graphs.\n","\n","In terms of performance, BFS and DFS were computationally simpler, as they do not require cost calculations or priority queues. However, their inability to account for edge weights makes them less suitable for cost-sensitive problems. UCS, though computationally more intensive, guarantees the optimal solution by evaluating both the path cost and graph structure. Overall, UCS is ideal for weighted graphs, while BFS and DFS are better suited for simpler or unweighted graph problems.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qinJknR5WEzC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733416829930,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":355,"user":{"displayName":"Zain","userId":"13454396303356700271"}}},"source":["#!pip install simpleai\n","from simpleai.search import SearchProblem, astar, greedy, breadth_first, depth_first, uniform_cost\n","import math"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pEDEpmGzXklh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733416833864,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":382,"user":{"displayName":"Zain","userId":"13454396303356700271"}}},"source":["COSTS = [\n","    [0, 7, 9, 'inf', 'inf', 14],\n","    [7, 0, 10, 15, 'inf', 'inf'],\n","    [9, 10, 0, 11, 'inf', 2],\n","    ['inf', 15, 11, 0, 6, 'inf'],\n","    ['inf', 'inf', 'inf', 6, 0, 9],\n","    [14, 'inf', 2, 'inf', 9, 0]\n","]\n"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vZKngpxpX8Lj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733416910711,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":402,"user":{"displayName":"Zain","userId":"13454396303356700271"}}},"source":["class Route(SearchProblem):\n","\n","    # initialise with the initial and goal states.
